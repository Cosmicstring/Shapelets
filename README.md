This is the shared code repository to build a dictionary of compound shapelets.

The project was titled _Galaxy Image Modelling Using shapelets_, and the codes are available [here](https://github.com/Cosmicstring/Shapelets/tree/master/codes/code/python_codes). A broader summary of research done is available at my [homepage](https://cosmicstring.github.io/)
