##  COMMENTS FOR IMAGE STABILITY ##

To do:
    -- Set properly the axis ratio for the polar plot so that the centers
    of squares align with appropriate m values
    
    Set up SVD:
        -- I just take n_nonzero biggest singular values from s and set the rest to 0, the same for
        coeffs_SVD
        // it looks pretty stable

Idx of chosen galaxy is 91 in pyfits

Compound basis:

	-- NO OF SHAPELETS IN THE BASIS:
		-- It seems 21 is a smallest possible one for a good result

	-- RECONSTRUCTION RANGE BETA:
		-- Image sparse_Compound_28_0_1.751_.png - beta 1.751 is pretty good in reconstructing the
		original image
		-- This suggest a range of beta (original/2., original*2)


Analysis of stability:
    
    -- It looks like the relative difference <N.C._i> / O.C._i - 1 is same for same coefficients (?)
